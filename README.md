# vk-to-spotify

-----------------------UNDER CONSTRUCTION---------------------------------------------------

This is a simple utility that works on Python and is made to transfer music from VK to Spotify.

All features working in CLI, so, just follow the lines and all be okay!


## Running

Working on Python 3.6+. Go to the directory with ``vk-to-spotify.py``, install and run it.

```bash
python setup.py install

python vk-to-spotify.py
```

Tip: If you encounter errors with no access to the directory, run as an administrator.

## How it works?

### Part I: Grabbing from VK


### Part II: Importing to Spotify

Okay, now we need to grant access, all actions are performed in the CLI. Just follow the lines.<br>
Type your username, then copy redirect-link (if it's your first time) to command line and press Enter.<br>
Just specify name of your secret stash with your lovely tracks from VK, he-he, and watch as the utility tries to find
them in Spotify.<br>
After completing this process, you can see which tracks were not found and will not be imported.<br>
Now we need to give a name to the playlist to which all tracks will be added, as well as its type, public or
private.<br>
Now, just watch the process as it ends, just check your playlists on Spotify. :yum:
